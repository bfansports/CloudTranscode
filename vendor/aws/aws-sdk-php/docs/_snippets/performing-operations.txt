You can perform a service **operation** by calling the method of the same name on the client object. For example, to
perform the `Amazon DynamoDB DescribeTable operation
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTable.html>`_, you must call the
``Aws\DynamoDb\DynamoDbClient::describeTable()`` method. Operation methods, like ``describeTable()``, all accept a
single argument that is an associative array of values representing the parameters to the operation. The structure of
this array is defined for each operation in the SDK's `API Documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/latest>`_
(e.g., see the `API docs for describeTable()
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/latest/class-Aws.DynamoDb.DynamoDbClient.html#_describeTable>`_).

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $dynamoDbClient->describeTable(array(
        'TableName' => 'YourTableName',
    ));
