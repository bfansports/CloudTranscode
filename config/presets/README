FFmpeg Presets
==============

Currently these are just the example presets that ship with the ffmpeg zip, inside the ffpreset folder. In order to use them, they need to be in  a directory called .ffmpeg in $HOME.

Yes, if you did a standard install you could just move them yourself. But it you used homebrew you would have to go and find them. Why do that? When you could just do this:


mkdir ~/.ffmpeg
cd .ffmpeg
git clone git://github.com/joeyblake/FFmpeg-Presets.git .


And be done.
